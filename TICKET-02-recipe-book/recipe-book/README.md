# Recipe Management Application

A small Vue 3 + TypeScript application for viewing, adding, deleting, and sorting recipes, with reactive aggregate statistics — built as a training exercise demonstrating typed interfaces, reactive state management, lifecycle-based data loading, and reusable component/composable architecture.

**Ticket:** TICKET-02-recipe-book
**Type:** Training / Skill Development
**Stack:** Vue 3 (Composition API), TypeScript

## Features

- View a list of recipes with name, ingredients, and vegetarian status
- Add a new recipe via a validated form
- Delete a recipe
- Sort recipes by name, creation date, or vegetarian status
- Live aggregate statistics: total recipe count and vegetarian count
- Simulated asynchronous data loading with loading/success/error states

## Tech & Patterns Demonstrated

- **TypeScript:** `Recipe` interface, union types, `Omit`, `Record`
- **Reactivity:** `ref`, `computed`, `onMounted`
- **Component architecture:** four dedicated components (`RecipeList`, `RecipeItem`, `RecipeForm`, `StatsDisplay`), each with a single responsibility
- **Component communication:** typed `props` and `emits`, with events forwarded up through intermediate components
- **Composables:** all state and business logic extracted into `useRecipes.ts`, keeping components focused on presentation and orchestration

- Backend/API integration (mock data only)
- Persistent storage (data resets on reload)
- Authentication or multi-user support
- Advanced styling or animations
